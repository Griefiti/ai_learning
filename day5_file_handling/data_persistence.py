'''What advantage does JSON have over plain text?'''
# JSON allows you to store structured data such as lists and dictionaries
'''Why is json.dump() + json.load() safer than eval()?'''
# It is because eval() interprets any string inputed as executable code
# this can result in malicious viruses and cyber-attacks.
# On the other hand, json..() doesnt execute anything, and merely stores data.
