'''Dictionaries are useful for _____ because _____.'''
# databases and storing related information because dictionaries can store pairs of data
'''Compared to lists and sets, they allow me to _____.'''
# store different datatypes which is very useful is some cases.
# Dictionaries are best for data that has a clear labelâ€“value relationship, like membership tiers or player scores.
