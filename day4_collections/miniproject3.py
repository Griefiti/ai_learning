# ============================================================
#  Project: Student Data & Club Manager
#  Author: [Sai Thant Zin]
#  Date: [30/10/2025]
#
#  Description:
#  A menu-driven Python program to manage student data using
#  tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Each student record contains:
#     - Tuple (Name, Age, Club Set)
#     - Set ensures each studentâ€™s clubs are unique
#     - Dictionary stores all students using their ID as key
#
#  Features:
#     1. Add a new student
#     2. View all students
#     3. Add club(s) to a student (case-insensitive)
#     4. Remove club(s) from a student (case-insensitive)
#     5. Search students by club
#     6. Exit the program
#
#  Notes:
#  - The sample dataset below is provided for quick testing/demo.
#  - You may set USE_SAMPLE_DATA = False to start with an empty dataset.
